## Document Organization and Folders

Create folders to group related pages logically, mimicking your project's structure. For example, organize payroll loan docs under `consignado/finance` and user guides under `consignado/guides`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to your workspace root. Click the `New Folder` button and name it `consignado-docs`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file-plus">
    Inside the folder, create pages like `setup.mdx` or `api-reference.mdx`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Subfolders" icon="folder">
    Right-click a folder to add subfolders, such as `consignado-docs/api` for endpoints.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming like `kebab-case` for folders to improve navigation.
</Callout>

## Version Control for Pages

Every edit creates a new version, allowing you to revert changes or compare diffs. View history via the page menu.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Draft] --> B[Publish v1.0]
    B --> C[Edit]
    C --> D[Publish v1.1]
    D --> E[Revert to v1.0]
```

<Expandable title="View Version Diff" default-open="false">
  Select `History` from the page menu. Compare `v1.1` with `v1.0` to spot additions like new API fields.
</Expandable>

## Collaboration Tools for Teams

Invite team members with role-based access: editors, reviewers, or viewers. Real-time editing and comments keep everyone aligned.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Editor Role" icon="edit-3">
    Make changes directly. Use `@mentions` to notify colleagues, e.g., `@jane Review this section`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reviewer Role" icon="eye">
    Add comments without editing. Resolve threads once addressed.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Viewer Role" icon="user">
    Read-only access for stakeholders.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Search and Indexing Functions

Full-text search indexes all pages instantly. Query terms like `consignado API` to surface relevant docs.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Live Search | Results update as you type |
| Filters | By folder, tag, or date |
| Advanced | Boolean operators: `API AND consignado` |

<Callout kind="info">
  Tags like `#finance` or `#security` enhance search precision.
</Callout>
